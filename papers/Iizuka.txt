Input : grayscale
Output : a plausible coloring scheme
Procedure : Fully automated

Color model : CIE Lab

Dataset:
    Places scene dataset [Zhou et al. 2014], which consists of 2,448,872 training images and 20,500 validation images

Approach
    Learn global features such as indoor/outdoor, day/night using a CNN
    Learn local features using another CNN
    Combine the two and learn colors using another CNN

    Eucledian distance used as error

    If labels available for images such as abbey, conference center, or volcano - include them in training global features
