Input : grayscale
Output : a plausible coloring scheme
Procedure : Fully automated

Color model : CIE Lab


Problem
Earlier approaches - desaturated colorization, else needed user input (why / how?).

Approach
Objective / Loss function tailored to this problem
re-weight the loss at training time to emphasize rare colors
predict a distribution of possible colors for each pixel
final colorization by taking the annealed-mean of the distribution

Details
CNN -> probability distribution over quantized color values for each pixel
CIE Lab color space - distances here model percuptual distances
L - given
a,b - ranges usually -100 to +100 or 8 bit.. Binned into 10x10
Out of 400 - 656 possible values, 313 are in range/gamut (visible/possible) = Q.
Hence, output = z = H*W*Q probability distribution
Convert this to actual color values y - annealed mean

Error
Convert ground truth colors Y to a probability distribution Z. 
Soft conversion - 5 nearest neighbors, value = Gaussian kernel with sigma=5 around ground truth bin.
Use multi-nomial cross entropy loss. 
Essentially, (-plogp), with weights for rebalancing rare colors.
Re-balanced for rare colors.
	For each bin, based on 1.3M dataset, compute emnpirical rarity of each bin, weight inverse to it.

Evaluation
Manual judgement - Turing test

Secondary contribution
We introduce the colorization task as a competitive and straightforward method for self-supervised representation, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.
representation learning = feature learning
